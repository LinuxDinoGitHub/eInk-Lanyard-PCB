## 10/5/2025 - The plan, initial notes  

# The plan

## Overview

Name: Dino2040
Cost (Budget): Under $20 per finalised PCB. (with components)
MCU: RP2040

The Dino2040, a name inspired by the Badger2040, is a low-cost lanyard pcb with an e-ink display. It can be accessed and changed easily with a UI interface and NFC, via power harvesting.

## Hardware and key features
- E-ink display, displays the following.
	- User name
	- Bio/Description
	- QR code/image
	- Notes/To Do List
- RP2040 MCU
- NT3H2111W0FHKH NFC Chip, used for data transfer and power harvesting

## Software
A QR code etched on the PCB to an app/website (possibly in react native as we need native features for NFC), with more detailed instructions.

The software will provide an interface for the user to manage the eInk display content, as mentioned above. 

That's it for the big overall plan, I spent around an hour researching into different techniques and components, ended up with this.

## 10/7/2025 - Started the schematic  

Started the schematic of the RP2040 MCU based on the useful guide and also datasheet. Spent some time researching the NFC module I should use as well since the old one metioned does not transfer data, looking at the ST25DV04KC module currently, may subject to change. 

Update: There will **not** be a radio module included as it will draw too much power. Instead, the PCB lanyard could be used as a development board (like a raspberry pi pico) because of all the excess IO pins.

Current progress:

## 10/8/2025 - Finished minimal requirements for RP2040 schematic  

# Journal notes
Using the guide of the datasheet and the HC guide, the schematic is like 50% finished (rp2040 min. requirements done). Still need to add footprints.

I also spent a majority of today researching the e-ink displays I could use (it turns out they are quite expensive, around $10 each). I think a 4-inch e-ink display could work well for a badge, as it is quite cost-effective. I found a lot of modules on Alibaba, but I have found that Taobao is much more resourceful, so I might look into that. 

The power supply system also requires some attention, as I plan to power it with a 3V coin cell battery, which can be a bit challenging for a beginner like me.

I'm not sure on the pinouts of eink displays, so I need to research more into the datasheet as well.
